## 🛠️ Infrastructure Intelligence
The **SRE Intelligence Hub** provides high-fidelity Machine Learning workflows tailored for modern observability. Every module leverages system telemetry—CPU, Memory, Network, and Log Levels—to solve critical production failure scenarios.

## 🏗️ Capabilities

### 🔍 Intelligent Monitoring (`03_machine_learning/`)
Solving the "hard" problems in production using ML:
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Native **Isolation Forest** implementation to detect DDoS attacks and database locks without manual thresholds.
*   **Log Clustering:** Automatic grouping of millions of unstructured logs into "Healthy", "Slow", and "Failing" behaviors.
*   **Predictive scaling:** Forecasting application latency based on concurrent connection spikes using Regression models.

### 🛡️ MLOps & Production Pipelines
ML is only useful if it runs reliably in a CI/CD environment.
*   **Leakage-Free Pipelines:** Preprocessing + models bundled for consistent deployment.
*   **Operational Metrics:** Prioritizing **Precision (Alert Fatigue)** and **Recall (Missed Outages)** over simple binary accuracy.
*   **Automated Tuning:** Self-optimizing hyperparameters for API timeout prediction via **GridSearchCV**.

### 📊 Observability Visuals (`02_visualization/`)
Professional-grade reporting designed for post-mortems and incident analysis.
*   **RCA Dashboards:** Automated charts with alert thresholds and OOM event markers.
*   **Drift Detection:** Using statistical tests (KS-test) to detect when infrastructure performance shifts permanently.

## ⚙️ Automation & Tooling
Built with a DevOps mindset, the hub includes CLI tools for speed and reproducibility.

### 📥 Data Ingestion (`fetch_data.py`)
Centralized data fetching with built-in **Integrity Verification (MD5 Hashes)**.
```bash
python fetch_data.py --quick     # Ingest small samples for fast testing
python fetch_data.py --full      # Ingest full datasets for training
python fetch_data.py --verify    # Verify data integrity against known hashes
```

### ⚡ Execution Modes (`notebook_toggle.py`)
Toggle between fast iteration and complete training directly from the CLI or within Jupyter.
*   **Quick Mode:** Uses 10% of data and 1/10th of iterations for instant feedback.
*   **Full Mode:** Leverages all CPU cores (`n_jobs=-1`) and full datasets for production-grade models.

We prioritize **Precision** (avoiding Alert Fatigue) ensuring that when a model fires, it's worth an engineer's attention.
